# Anyan Site Blog

This project is with the primary focus of building a personal portfolio as a baseline. On top of this concept, I plan to implement several features, including a blog as well as an area to showcase and demo current personal projects. Most importantly, I hope to continually build onto this project to find more ways I can play and have fun with React.
